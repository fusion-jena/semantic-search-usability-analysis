# Data corpus preparation

For our evaluation, we utilized various applications and scripts for the download and preparation of the [GFBio](https://www.gfbio.org) metadata corpus.

1. Metadata files have been downloaded with the code provided in https://github.com/fusion-jena/GFBioMetadata
2. For the query preparation, we expanded the original search tasks with scripts and instruction provided in the QuestionExpansion folder, a test corpus is provided in [GFBioTestCorpus](https://github.com/fusion-jena/semantic-search-usability-analysis/tree/main/data_corpus_preparation/GFBioTestCorpus)
3. We utilized the [Biodivtagger](https://github.com/fusion-jena/BiodivTagger) and [OrganismTagger](https://www.semanticsoftware.info/organism-tagger) pipelines based on the [GATE framework](https://github.com/GateNLP) to annotate these metadata files. In order to properly load GFBio metadata files into GATE, a plugin is necessary provided in [GFBioDocumentFormat](https://github.com/fusion-jena/semantic-search-usability-analysis/tree/main/data_corpus_preparation/GFBioDocumentFormat).
4. For faster annotation and indexing, small thread pipelines are provided in [AnnotateGFBioCorpus](https://github.com/fusion-jena/semantic-search-usability-analysis/tree/main/data_corpus_preparation/AnnotateGFBioCorpus) and [ParallelIndexing](https://github.com/fusion-jena/semantic-search-usability-analysis/tree/main/data_corpus_preparation/ParallelIndexing).
5. Folder [SearchIndex](https://github.com/fusion-jena/semantic-search-usability-analysis/tree/main/data_corpus_preparation/SearchIndex) contains the index file for a [GATE MÃ¬mir index](https://github.com/GateNLP/mimir)

## Text mining pipelines

The extended BiodivTagger and the OrganismTagger pipelines, which were utilized for this evaluation, are available at Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7438208.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7438208)
