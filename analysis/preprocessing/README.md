# Data preprocessing

For easier analysis we have to merge the individual survey results into one file. In addition, the analysis on the task success and the log files need to be processed beforehand. Run the scripts sequentially to obtain the 'complete_dataset.csv' file that can be analyzed with the provided Jupyter notebook.

# Prerequisites

All scripts have been implemented and tested with Python 3.9

# Instructions

Navigate to the pre-processing folder and run

```
get_task_success.py
```

```
analyze_log_files.py
```

```
create_final_dataset.py
```
