Privacy Policy  Dear scholar,  From 25th May 2018, the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (in German: Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, DSGVO) has come into effect. For compliance reasons we are obliged to get your consent on the privacy policy before collecting any kind of personal information.   The following information applies as a supplement to the general privacy policy of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. We request you to please kindly read both policies carefully and to agree.     Definition    We use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:  When we say…  			…we mean  		“Friedrich Schiller University Jena”/”we”/”us”/”our”  			The Friedrich Schiller University Jena, a non-profit organization that conducts this survey.  		“this survey”  			The forms on this website that collect your answers.  		“personal information”  			Information you provide us or information we collect from you that could be used to personally identify you. We consider at least the following to be “personal information”: 			your affiliation, email address, IP address, operating system, browser 			  		“third party”  			Individuals, entities, websites, services, products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by the Friederich Schiller University Jena  		Collection and Use of Information    How do we collect personal information?  In this survey, we only collect data about your research context such as primarily research fields, graduation and use of dataset search applications.  While browsing, some general information are stored in the server log files. We collect (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system (3) the date and time of access to the Internet site (4) and the Internet protocol address (IP address).  All this information is needed to deliver correct website content and to optimize web content continuously. In case of cyber-attacks, log files provide necessary information for criminal prosecution.    How do we use that information?  We use your answers to analyze how scholars' search for research data to improve our services of data-centered search tools and methods.     Sharing    We support the idea of generating only FAIR data. Thus, we intend to publish all answers as open data in a data repository with a digital identifier (e.g., DOI) and descriptive metadata. That ensures long-term data curation, data citation, data retrieval and data reuse. We also intend to publish the results in an open access journal.     Protection    How do we protect your data?  We take data protection seriously. The survey website is hosted on servers of the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany, Europe. We backup the survey regularly und provide an encrypted access to the website by using the https protocol.     How long do we keep your data?  As mentioned above, we would like to publish your answer as open data in a data repository for long-term data storage.     Your Rights    You have the right to access your personal data and the right to let your personal data be corrected.  You may review, update, correct or delete your personal data by contacting the survey organizers. Send an email to felicitas.loeffler@uni-jena.de with your request, e.g., that you want us to delete your personal data from our system.    Important Information    Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is:  Friedrich Schiller University Jena Fürstengraben 1 07743 Jena  The Data Protection Officer of the controller is:  Dr. Stefanie Buchmann Friedrich Schiller University Jena +49 3641 9-31087stefanie.buchmann@uni-jena.de     If we change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page.
